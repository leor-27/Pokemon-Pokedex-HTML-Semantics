                <p>Fighting Pokémon are strong and muscle-bound, often based on martial artists. Fighting moves are super-effective against five other types (as is Ground), making them very good offensively. 
                    Most Fighting type moves are in the Physical category, for obvious reasons.</p>

                <p>Ghosts are rare Pokémon, and the only type to have two immunities. Later games have added more to the roster so they now sit third from bottom in terms of numbers, above Ice and Fairy.
                    In the first generation, Ghost moves has no effect on Psychic Pokémon, however, it was later changed to be super-effective. When paired with the Dark type it was the only type combination to have no weaknesses before the Fairy type was introduced in Gen 6.</p>

                    They are notoriously difficult to train due to requiring more EXP points per level than most non-legendary Pokémon, and the fact they evolve much later means they are in 
                    their weaker forms for longer. Interestingly, many final-evolution Dragon types have a 4x weakness to the Ice type.</p>
